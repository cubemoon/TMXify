TMXify

# Introduction

TMX maps are an excellent means of creating levels for games. While mainly for side-scrollers and orthogonal games they can be adapted for a wide range of games. The maps are driven by XML and contain a compressed map of tiles drawn in the map using a group of tiles called a tileset.

This project was designed to take the functionality of the awesome Tiled TMX editor (http://mapeditor.org) and bring a subset of it to the web. This would allow games developed to use TMX maps to allow their users to create their own maps and import them into the game.

Additionally an eventual central place to edit and share maps will be created @ tmxify.com but that is still a ways off.
